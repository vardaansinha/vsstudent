During the summer, I worked on a notebook on Pandas in Python (a very important module) for this year's DNHS CS Curriculum.

It is linked here: https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher//c4.0/2023/09/13/python-pandas_intro_IPYNB_2_.html



I have planned to work on other lessons comprising of:

- AI and ML 

- Data Science and Data Wrangling in Python


I will be working on these throughout the trimester and hope to make good progress.
