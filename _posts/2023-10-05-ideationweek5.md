In this blog, we'll go through the ideation and brainstorming process for our group's passion project.

<br>


**IDEATION: STAGE 1**

First off, we wanted to create a CNN (in Java) for detecting lung disease. Here is the issue I created:

<br>

**IDEATION: STAGE 2**

However, we quickly learned that this idea was not sustainable, would be too hard to create, and we simply did not have the time. We wanted to instead create a project that would have more use to the class and would be more applicable to what we were learning in CSA. Therefore, we came up with CSCanvas: an application better than Canvas for Del Norte CS Students to submit assignments, view important information, and get easily graded for weekly assignments.

<br>

**IDEATION: STAGE 3**

During the ideation period, our group worked on assigning roles, establishing a framework for our project, and trying to understand how we would finish on time with a working product.

**AFTER OUR REVIEW WITH MR. MORT, WE REALIZED THAT WE NEEDED TO MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS AND CONSOLIDATE OUR FEATURES SO THAT WE COULD FOCUS IN ON WHAT THE MAIN PRIORITY WAS.**

Therefore, we decided that my role would be initially to help everyone establish the groundwork for their features, and then focus on creating the login page. From our Discord Group Chat, here are the priorities we collectively came up with for my feature:

1. Make sure the Teacher has a special key to login so that it leads them to a different page where they have an administrator dashboard. Here, they should be able to create/modify/delete assignments and see the GitHub analytics of different students submitting assignments.

2. There should be a student login - here, the students should be able to enter their lunch number ID (NOTE: THIS WAS LATER CHANGED TO THEIR GITHUB ID FOR API PURPOSES) and then be able to see all the assignments they have due, and have a place to submit their work and add comments.

<br>

So, after Week 5 (the first week assigned to ideation) there was no working code. There was only an idea with models.
