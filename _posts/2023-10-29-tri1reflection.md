**MEMORIES AND LEARNINGS FROM TRIMESTER 1**

1. One thing I learned from this trimester was the value of having proper discussions during the ideation period of projects. In the past, especially during CSP, the groups that I was in solely emphasized making commits, having tangibles to show, and having some sort of actual progress that we generally had mishaps in the initial process stage which led to even greater mishaps when creating the project. During this trimester, however, our group had actual discussions and we all voiced our opinions on project ideas, project features, reviews, and other such things, that when it came time to actually create a product, the process has been a lot smoother and more efficient with as little conflict as possible.


2. Trimester 1 of CSA has been all about Java. In AP CSP, the emphasis was on getting an introduction to Computer Science and basic coding frameworks via HTML, MD, JavaScript, and Python. Now, in AP CSA, I have started my journey into Java programming. I have learned a lot about the similarities and differences between Java and other languages, and have seen a lot of growth in my programming diversity now that Java is slowly being added to my toolkit. 


3. CORE MEMORY: The FRQ Mini-Lab was a pretty cool part of Trimester 1. I got to dive in first hand to how Arrays and ArrayLists operated and we were able to teach it to another group of people, gather diverse perspectives on the same types of FRQs/Topics, and give each other feedback. This was very useful, as I got to learn more about all the types of things I would see on the AP Exam.
