    "Throughout this FRQ, we had to utilize static methods to perform operations on 1D and 2D Arrays/Array lists. This involved sorting the elements inside of the arrays and computing sums in order to find differences between different rows of multiple arrays. Using iterative loops throughout the FRQs was necessary in order to iterate through the different elements in the arrays, and it made the job quite easy. Once part (a) and part (b) were completed, they needed to be merged into the code for part (c) so that it could be run as a whole program (DiverseArray). "

Each of the arrays contained the amount of fantasy points that each player generated on a team, and then many operations could be performed - when checking for diverse arrays, that could be compared to seeing if two teams are going to tie with each other, or when checking for row sums, that could simply be calculating the total number of projected fantasy points a team is going to receive.
