    "Throughout this FRQ, knowledge of methods and control structures were necessary. First of all, through creating the NumberGroup interface, we had to create an interface which represented a group of integers and had a method to check if an integer was in that group. We had to write a \"contains\" method. In the Range class in part b, we had to implement the contains method, and had to use control structures through conditional statements to check whether or not an integer was within the range. Finally, with the MultipleGroups class, which implemented the NumberGroup interface, control structures were used to iterate over each NumberGroup and see if an integer was in any of them. The entire FRQ had a lot to do with implementing interfaces, classes, methods, and control structures in Java. "
