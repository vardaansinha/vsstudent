    "\n",
    "1. cd\n",
    "  - cd stands for \"change directory\"\n",
    "  - This is often used via WSL to switch between repositories and directories within repositories to access different files\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ls\n",
    "  - ls is Linux's primary listing method\n",
    "  - Through ls (and it's many additional parameter extensions) you can list the files in a particular directory\n",
    "  - You can add certain parameters after ls to show hidden files or certain types of file extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. cat\n",
    "  - This is more often going to be used when working in the AWS environment\n",
    "  - The command is used to gather the full body of a file and display it in a terminal rather than having to go into a text editor to view it\n",
    "\n",
    "4. sudo\n",
    "  - More than a command, this can be considered a precursor to all the commands you run on Linux when you are a primary editor\n",
    "  - sudo denotes giving yourself root permissions to perform certain actions on your system which a standard user is unable to\n",
    "\n",
    "5. mkdir and touch\n",
    "  - If you need to make a new directory inside of a repository - mkdir is utilized\n",
    "  - If you want to create a new file, you can utilize the touch command inside of the repository you wish to create a file in"
