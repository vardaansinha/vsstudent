First of all, through creating the NumberGroup interface, we had to create an interface which represented a group of integers and had a method to check if an integer was in that group. We had to write a \"contains\" method. In the Range class in part b, we had to implement the contains method, and had to use control structures through conditional statements to check whether or not an integer was within the range. Finally, with the MultipleGroups class, which implemented the NumberGroup interface, control structures were used to iterate over each NumberGroup and see if an integer was in any of them. The entire FRQ had a lot to do with implementing interfaces, classes, methods, and control structures in Java. "

I had to utilize the scoring guidelines with some internet surfing to understand some of the parts of the FRQs and their solutions, so I will make sure that I work harder to understand these FRQs. However, questions 1 & 2 on ArrayLists and Classes were not as bad, since they were a little less complex. It gave me a good review of some of the Java basics. Furthermore, as per project implementations, there were definitely basic utilizations of arrays, classes, and methods/control structures - however, if we want to store our data in a different way in the backend, we could utilize 2D arrays - with each row representing a different team in a fantasy league or something along those lines. We would need to explore this more and have a more concrete understanding of how to implement 2D arrays in the full-stack to do this. "
