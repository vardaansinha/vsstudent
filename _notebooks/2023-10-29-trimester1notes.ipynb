    "**UNIT 2 IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1 Learning Objective - Relationship between Class and Object:**\n",
    "- In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
    "- An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "- The class defines the structure and behavior of the object.\n",
    "- Objects created from the same class share the same characteristics but can have different data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2 Learning Objective - Calling Constructors:**\n",
    "- Constructors are special methods used to create objects.\n",
    "- They have the same name as the class and can be called to create objects.\n",
    "- Constructors can be called without parameters or with parameters, allowing you to initialize object data during creation.\n",
    "- When calling a constructor, you should specify the correct types of parameters based on the constructor's signature.\n",
    "- For example, `new MyClass()` calls a parameterless constructor, and `new MyClass(param1, param2)` calls a constructor with parameters `param1` and `param2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3 Learning Objective - Calling Non-Static Void Methods (Without Parameters):**\n",
    "- In Java, methods are functions defined within a class that perform specific tasks.\n",
    "- Non-static void methods do not return a value and are called using an object.\n",
    "- You can call such methods without passing any parameters.\n",
    "- For example, if you have an object `myObject` of class `MyClass`, you can call `myObject.myMethod()` to execute a non-static void method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.4 Learning Objective - Calling Non-Static Void Methods (With Parameters):**\n",
    "- Non-static void methods can also accept parameters.\n",
    "- When calling these methods, you need to pass the required parameters as specified in the method's signature.\n",
    "- For example, if you have a method `myMethod` that takes parameters `param1` and `param2`, you can call it using `myObject.myMethod(param1, param2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.5 Learning Objective - Calling Non-Static Non-Void Methods:**\n",
    "- Non-static non-void methods return a value when executed.\n",
    "- These methods may or may not accept parameters.\n",
    "- When calling such methods, you can capture the return value.\n",
    "- The return type of the method should match the type of variable used to store the result.\n",
    "- For example, `int result = myObject.calculateSum(x, y)` captures the result of a non-static non-void method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.6 Learning Objective - String Class Methods:**\n",
    "- The String class in Java is used to work with text.\n",
    "- You can create String objects and perform various operations using String methods.\n",
    "- String methods allow you to manipulate and analyze text data, such as finding the length of a string, concatenating strings, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.7 Learning Objective - String Class (More API and Packages Centric):**\n",
    "- Java's `java.lang` package contains essential classes, including the String class.\n",
    "- When working with the String class, you can handle exceptions like `IndexOutOfBoundsException` when accessing characters beyond the string's length.\n",
    "- The `java.lang` package provides core functionality and is automatically imported into Java programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.8 Learning Objective - Wrapper Classes (Integer and Double):**\n",
    "- Wrapper classes are used to work with primitive data types as objects.\n",
    "- Integer and Double are examples of wrapper classes for int and double data types.\n",
    "- You can create Integer and Double objects, and call their respective methods to perform operations like conversion and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.9 Learning Objective - Calling Static Methods and Math Class:**\n",
    "- Static methods belong to a class rather than a specific object.\n",
    "- You can call static methods using the class name.\n",
    "- The Math class in Java provides a set of mathematical functions and constants.\n",
    "- You can call methods from the Math class to perform mathematical operations.\n"

    "**UNIT 3 IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.1 Learning Objective - Evaluate Boolean Expressions with Relational Operators:**\n",
    "- In programming, we often use Boolean expressions to make decisions.\n",
    "- These expressions involve the use of relational operators to compare values.\n",
    "- Types of Relational Operators include:\n",
    "    - Equal to: `==`\n",
    "    - Not Equal to: `!=`\n",
    "    - Greater than: `>`\n",
    "    - Less than: `<`\n",
    "    - Greater than or equal to: `>=`\n",
    "    - Less than or equal to: `<=`\n",
    "- These operators return either `true` or `false` based on the comparison result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 Learning Objectives - Conditional Statements:**\n",
    "- Conditional statements are used to represent branching logical processes in code.\n",
    "- Nested if-else statements allow you to create more complex decision trees.\n",
    "- Compound boolean expressions combine multiple conditions using logical operators:\n",
    "    - `&&` (logical AND) returns `true` if both conditions are `true`.\n",
    "    - `||` (logical OR) returns `true` if at least one condition is `true`.\n",
    "- Short-circuited evaluation means that if a logical expression can be determined with only the evaluation of the first part, the second part may not be evaluated. This can be used for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.6 Learning Objective - De Morgan's Law:**\n",
    "- De Morgan's Law is a set of rules that help simplify and understand complex boolean expressions.\n",
    "- It allows us to rewrite expressions involving logical NOT, AND, and OR operators.\n",
    "- The rules state that:\n",
    "    - NOT (A AND B) is equivalent to (NOT A) OR (NOT B).\n",
    "    - NOT (A OR B) is equivalent to (NOT A) AND (NOT B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.7 Learning Objective - Comparing Object References:**\n",
    "- In programming, you often need to compare object references to determine if they refer to the same object.\n",
    "- This is done using boolean expressions.\n",
    "- The `==` operator is used for object reference comparison. It checks if two references point to the same object in memory.\n",
    "- It's important to note that `==` compares the memory address, not the content of the objects.\n",
    "- For comparing the content of objects, especially with Strings, you should use `.equals()` or `.compareTo()` methods instead of the `==` operator.\n",

    "**4.1 Learning Objective - Represent Iterative Processes Using a While Loop:**\n",
    "- In programming, iterative processes involve repeating a set of instructions or statements.\n",
    "- A while loop is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.\n",
    "- The while loop checks the condition before each iteration, and if the condition becomes false, the loop terminates.\n",
    "- While loops are useful for tasks that need to be performed a certain number of times or until a specific condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.3 Learning Objective - String Manipulation Methods in Java:**\n",
    "- When working with String objects in Java, various methods are available to manipulate and work with strings.\n",
    "- `String.substring` is used to retrieve a particular portion of a string, allowing you to extract a substring based on its starting and ending positions.\n",
    "- `String.equals` is used to compare the content of two strings, checking if they are equal in content.\n",
    "- `String.length` is used to determine the length (number of characters) in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.4 Learning Objective - Nested Iteration Processes:**\n",
    "- Nested iteration involves using one or more loops inside another loop.\n",
    "- This technique allows you to perform more complex repetitive tasks and iterate through multi-dimensional data structures.\n",
    "- Common nested loops include using nested for loops to traverse 2D arrays and matrices.\n",
    "- Proper control structures and loop conditions are essential to avoid infinite loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.5 Learning Objective - Informal Code Analysis:**\n",
    "- Informal code analysis is the process of understanding, reviewing, and evaluating code without formally applying formal methods.\n",
    "- One aspect of code analysis involves counting statement executions, which indicates how many times a statement is executed during program execution.\n",
    "- Understanding statement execution counts helps in analyzing code behavior and identifying performance bottlenecks.\n",

    "**6.1 Array Creation and Access:**\n",
    "- An array is a data structure used to implement a collection of object reference data.\n",
    "- Elements are the individual values stored within an array.\n",
    "- The index of an element is the position of that element within the array.\n",
    "- In Java, the first element of an array is at index 0, and the last element is at index (length - 1).\n",
    "- The length of an array is the number of elements it contains, representing the size of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.2 Traversing Array (1D):**\n",
    "- In Java, arrays are indexed from 0 to the number of elements minus one.\n",
    "- Standard for loops are a common way to iterate through arrays.\n",
    "- The for loop typically has three components:\n",
    "    - `init`: The initialization expression initializes a variable and is executed only once.\n",
    "    - `condition`: The condition statement is evaluated for every iteration, and the loop continues as long as the condition is true.\n",
    "    - `incr/decr`: The increment or decrement statement is applied to the variable, updating the initial expression, and is executed after each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.3 Enhanced For Loop for Arrays:**\n",
    "- The enhanced for loop, also known as the \"for-each\" loop, provides a simplified way to loop through elements in an array, collection, or other iterable data structures.\n",
    "- It eliminates the need for explicit index management and simplifies code for iterating through elements.\n",
    "- Enhanced for loops are particularly useful when you need to iterate through all elements in a collection sequentially.\n",

    "**6.4 Developing Algorithms Using Arrays:**\n",
    "- Developing algorithms involving arrays is a fundamental aspect of programming.\n",
    "- Algorithms define a step-by-step process to solve a specific problem.\n",
    "- Arrays are commonly used in various algorithms to store, manipulate, and process data efficiently.\n",

    "**7.2 ArrayList Methods:**\n",
    "- ArrayLists are used to represent collections of related object reference data.\n",

    "**8.1: What is a 2D Array?**\n",
    "- A 2D array, also known as a two-dimensional array, is a data structure that stores elements in rows and columns.\n",
    "- It can be thought of as a table or grid of elements, with each element identified by its row and column index.\n",
    "- 2D arrays are used to represent structured data, such as matrices, tables, or images.\n",
    "- They provide a way to organize and access data in a grid-like fashion, making them useful for various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8.2: Traversing 2D Arrays:**\n",
    "- Traversing a 2D array involves iterating through its elements to access and process data.\n",
    "- Common methods for traversing 2D arrays include nested loops, where one loop iterates over rows, and another loop iterates over columns.\n",
    "- Proper control structures are essential to ensure that all elements are visited, and the desired order of traversal is maintained.\n",
    "- Traversing 2D arrays is crucial for performing operations on structured data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8.3: Image Representation with 2D Arrays:**\n",
    "- 2D arrays are commonly used to represent images in computer graphics and image processing.\n",
    "- In this context, each element of the 2D array corresponds to a pixel in the image.\n",
    "- The color information for each pixel is stored in the array, allowing for the manipulation and processing of images.\n",
    "- 2D arrays are used to create, modify, and analyze images in various applications, including graphics software, digital photography, and computer vision.\n",
